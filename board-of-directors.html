          <p class="text-md text-center p-6">
            With an educational background in marketing and journalism,
            Virinderpaul Singh has seamlessly been able to work in different
            capacities from accounting, locations and production management at
            the Directors Guild of Canada for the past eight years. Looking for
            a way to eventually realize his dreams, he started creating personal
            projects that could help pivot his career path. All this while
            working on productions for Disney, Paramount, Netflix, and CBC,
            which ultimately helped hone his skills as a producer. His passion
            for focusing on hard-hitting issues within the South Asian diaspora
            is what gravitates him toward his next project Vinod c/o Edmonton.
            Always willing to expand upon his craft, Virinderpaul was admitted
            into the Whistler Film Festival's Producers Lab in 2021, and has
            recently graduated from the 2023 Reelworld Producers Program, a
            year-long curriculum that provides mentoring and learning
            opportunities to build a career as a Producer. Virinderpaul has
            directed several movies including Lohri (2022), a powerful family
            drama exploring gender roles in a traditional Punjabi household. In
            the last five years, he's produced multiple short films and
            documentaries, which has resulted in his producing a coming-of-age
            Sikh feature film called Jersey Boy in Hamilton, Ontario.
